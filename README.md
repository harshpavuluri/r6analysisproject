# Rainbow Six Siege Stat Analysis/ Prediction Project
As a avid Rainbow Six Siege player, the game is almost a part of who am I. But also a programmer, I want analyze my patterns and how I'm improving over time. So utilizing the R6 Stat API, I seek to provide statstics on the any player and provide a deep insight into how that player functions and how they player on a normal basis. This can hopefully be expanded into other places such as figuring out team dynamics and chemistry to see how a ranked match will play out, or figuring out which friends you want to play with for the day.
